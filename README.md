## Binary Tree With Bowling Scores and Names
This Program is to demonstrate on how a Binary Tree works with inserting and deleting nodes in a tree. This is an 
attempt to demonstrate that. For my example, I used bowling scores and names and I would sort the results by scores by 
in-order traversal
